# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug
This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The bug is caused by an incorrect loop condition that tries to access an array element outside its valid range.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java to avoid runtime exceptions.
